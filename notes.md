each commit has a specific number. You can compare those numbers to make sure the commit is the correct one.

I have added a bunch to the project.

I have an index page. It has our logo and main purpose. From there you can go to the about us page our sign in to access the sales page.

The sales page has different lots. Each lot has a sheep that is currently for sale and the price of each sheep. 

The about us page has each of the 5 of us and a little bit about each of us. I included this page because the industry is all about face recognition

I originally planned on having a tours page but we are not quite ready for that on the farm side of everything. I am planning on adding that in a year or so when we get everything figured out.

There is a space for application data which will display the name they entered

There is a database plan. It will store names with the emails so I can contact people in the future

There is also a place for the websocket data. Each of the lots will have a like button and a comment section. This will be available for everyone to see.
